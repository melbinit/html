        <b>Fnatic took down Vision Strikers today in the Group D winners match and are the first team to qualify for the
            VALORANT Champions playoffs. </b>
        <br><br>

        </ol>


        <p>
            Fnatic started the series on their map pick, Icebox, and immediately won the first five rounds. Vision
            Strikers managed to plant the Spike each round, but Fnatic consistently retook the sites to save the day.
            Vision Strikers didn’t let them run away with the win, though, and won the next six rounds to gain the lead.
            Stax won a one-vs-four situation in round nine, showing how effective he can be when isolated. Fnatic won
            the final round of the half to secure a 6-6 scoreline and an even playing field going into the second half.
        </p>

        <p>
            Vision Strikers started their defense strong with two round wins before Fnatic broke the streak in round 15.
            Vision Strikers answered back in round 16, but Fnatic won the next four rounds with a dominant offense.
            <b>Doma </b>and <b> Derke </b> secured 4Ks during this streak, putting their raw gun skill on display.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i> Vision Strikers won one final round before Fnatic closed out the map 13-10. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first half on Haven was another back and forth affair as each team prevented the other from winning more
            than three rounds in a row. Fnatic did an excellent job on defense, although Vision Strikers made them work
            hard for every small victory. One of the best examples of this was Boaster narrowly preventing the Spike
            from being defused in round eight after almost every player used an ability to protect or attack the B site.

            <p>
                The first half finished with another 6-6 stalemate, but this time it was Vision Striker’s turn to
                dominate the second half.

                Vision Strikers won the pistol and following round before Fnatic went on a four-round winning streak.
                But this was the last time the European team tasted victory on this map. Vision Strikers won the final
                five rounds to force the series to map three.
